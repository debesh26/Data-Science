In ecommerce companies like online retails , customer segmentation is necessary in order to understand customers behaviors. 
It leverages aqcuired customer data like the one we have in our case , i.e. transactions data , in order to divide customers into groups. 

Approach :

	- First perform RFM Analysis
	- Then form clusters of  customer types based on RFM.


RFM Analysis :

	- Recency(R)		:   Days since last purchase 
	- Frequency (F)		:   Total number of purchases 
	- Monetary (M)	   	:   Total money this customer spent.

	Hence , each customer has the above 3 attributes.

	-  This is a customer segmentation technique that uses past purchase behavior to divide customers into groups. 
	-  To identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions and also for future personalization services.
	-  It answers these questions :
		Who are our best customers ?
		Who has the potential to be converted in more profitable customers ?
		Which customers we must retain ?
		Which group of customers is most likely to respond to our current campaign ?


Customer clustering helps in :

	-   Increasing revenue
	-   Increasing customer retention
	-   Discovering trends and patterns
	-   Defining customers at risk
